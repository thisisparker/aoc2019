## Day 4

Pretty straightforward puzzle, mostly boils down to rewriting prose rules as written checks. I can imagine people who have written a lot of tests zoomed through this! Even I was able to complete this one much faster than yesterday.

I did not remember that `string`s [have a `count()` method in Python](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#str.count), which cost me a few minutes in part II as I tried to reimplement it by hand. Fortunately something jogged my memory and I looked it up, and got back on track to finish Part II.

I feel like `any()` and `all()` are sort of uncommon in Python I read, but [they're built in](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) and definitely come in handy, especially for situations like this one.
