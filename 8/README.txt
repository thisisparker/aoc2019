## Day 8

Refreshingly straightforward puzzle after the intcode disaster yesterday! I
almost couldn't believe *how* straightforward it was (it could be whittled
down to a one-liner or so) which almost definitely means it's going to come
back in a much more difficult fashion soon.

The only thing that tripped me up for a second is that I'd mixed up the
behavior of `continue` and `break` on the nested loop.
